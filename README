pkgbuddy is a tool designed to assited with making flat nopayload packages. It handles creating the folder structure and passing all of the appropriate arguments to /usr/bin/pkgbuild.

The only required option that needs to be passed is --script -s with the script you would like wrapped up in a pkg. 

Usage: 
pkgbuddy --script filename [--packagename value] [--version value] [--myorg value] [--forcedreciepts]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SCRIPT, --script=SCRIPT
                        Script you would like wrapped into a flat package.
  -p PACKAGENAME, --packagename=PACKAGENAME
                        Define a output package name.
  -v VERSION, --version=VERSION
                        Set package version
  -o MYORG, --myorg=MYORG
                        Set Organzation name this is used as a prefix Not
                        Required
  -f, --forcedreciepts  Force reciepts to be created. This is achieved by
                        writing a file to /var/db/reciepts. This makes the
                        package technically not a no payload package.
